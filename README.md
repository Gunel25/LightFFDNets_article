## About the Project  
Accurate and rapid facial forgery detection is essential in fields like **artificial intelligence**, **image processing**, and **object detection**. This project introduces **LightFFDNet v1** and **LightFFDNet v2**, two lightweight convolutional neural network models designed to efficiently detect facial forgeries.  

The key contributions of this project are:  
1. **LightFFDNet v1**:  
   - Only two convolutional layers.  
   - High speed and competitive accuracy.  
   - Suitable for resource-constrained environments.  
2. **LightFFDNet v2**:  
   - Incorporates five convolutional layers.  
   - Delivers enhanced accuracy, especially on larger datasets.  
   - Maintains computational efficiency.  

The models were evaluated using the **Fake-Vs-Real-Faces (Hard)** and **140k Real and Fake Faces** datasets.
