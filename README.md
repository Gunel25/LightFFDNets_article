LightFFDNet: Lightweight CNNs for Facial Forgery Detection LightFFDNet v1 (3-layer) and v2 (6-layer) are efficient models for detecting facial forgeries. Tested on Fake-Vs-Real-Faces(Hard) and 140k Real and Fake Faces datasets, they offer high accuracy, speed, and low computational cost, ideal for resource-constrained environments.
